# Multiplatform Frameworks
This is a research project to evaluate multi-platform frameworks

## Requirements

Here is a list of requirements.

1. Supports React applications
2. Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript
3. Supports the following target platforms:
- Win10
- MacOS
- iOS
- Android
- Linux
- PWA (Progressive Web App)

## Evaluation Criteria

The following features will distinguish one framework from another:

- Conversion of existing React Web apps to the supported platforms
- Detect updates to code and facilitates update process
- Enables work offline and sync when back online
- Can use `yarn`

## List of Frameworks Evaluated

This is the initial list of frameworks to evaluate:

- [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-ionic-react/)

There will be folders with the framework name where all the material for each is housed.
Each product folder will have a `README` with notes, questions, issues, and (importantly) a summary of the evaluation.

This `README` will have a summary comparing the products and making recommendations.
